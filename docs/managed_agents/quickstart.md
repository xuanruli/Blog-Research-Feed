# Get started with Claude Managed Agents

This guide walks you through creating an agent, setting up an environment, starting a session, and streaming agent responses.

**Prefer an interactive walkthrough?** Run `/claude-api managed-agents-onboard` in the latest version of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) for a guided setup and interactive question-answering.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent** | The model, system prompt, tools, MCP servers, and skills |
| **Environment** | Configuration for where sessions run: an Anthropic-managed cloud sandbox, or a self-hosted sandbox on your own infrastructure |
| **Session** | A running agent instance within an environment, performing a specific task and generating outputs |
| **Events** | Messages exchanged between your application and the agent (user turns, tool results, status updates) |

## Prerequisites

- An Anthropic [Console account](https://platform.claude.com/)
- An [API key](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys)

## Install the CLI

Homebrew (macOS):

```
brew install anthropics/tap/ant
```

Check the installation:

```
ant --version
```

## Install the SDK

Python:

```
pip install anthropic
```

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Create your first session

All Managed Agents API requests require the `managed-agents-2026-04-01` beta header. The SDK sets the beta header automatically.

1. **Create an agent**

   Create an agent that defines the model, system prompt, and available tools.

   ```
   ant beta:agents create \
        --name "Coding Assistant" \
        --model '{id: claude-opus-4-8}' \
        --system "You are a helpful coding assistant. Write clean, well-documented code." \
        --tool '{type: agent_toolset_20260401}'
   ```

   The `agent_toolset_20260401` tool type enables the full set of pre-built agent tools (bash, file operations, web search, and more). See [Tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/tools) for the complete list and per-tool configuration options.

   Save the returned `agent.id`. You'll reference it in every session you create.

2. **Create an environment**

   An environment defines the sandbox where your agent runs.

   ```
   ant beta:environments create \
        --name "quickstart-env" \
        --config '{type: cloud, networking: {type: unrestricted}}'
   ```

   Save the returned `environment.id`. You'll reference it in every session you create.

   To run the sandbox on your own infrastructure instead of a cloud sandbox, see [Self-hosted sandboxes](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/self-hosted-sandboxes).

3. **Start a session**

   Create a session that references your agent and environment.

   ```
   session = client.beta.sessions.create(
          agent=agent.id,
          environment_id=environment.id,
          title="Quickstart session",
   )

   print(f"Session ID: {session.id}")
   ```

4. **Send a message and stream the response**

   Open a stream, send a user event, then process events as they arrive:

   ```
   with client.beta.sessions.events.stream(session.id) as stream:
          # Send the user message after the stream opens
          client.beta.sessions.events.send(
              session.id,
              events=[
                  {
                      "type": "user.message",
                      "content": [
                          {
                              "type": "text",
                              "text": "Create a Python script that generates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers and saves them to fibonacci.txt",
                          },
                      ],
                  },
              ],
          )

          # Process streaming events
          for event in stream:
              match event.type:
                  case "agent.message":
                      for block in event.content:
                          print(block.text, end="")
                  case "agent.tool_use":
                      print(f"\n[Using tool: {event.name}]")
                  case "session.status_idle":
                      print("\n\nAgent finished.")
                      break
   ```

   The agent writes a Python script, executes it in the sandbox, and verifies the output file was created. Your output looks similar to this:

   ```
   I'll create a Python script that generates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers and saves them to a file.
   [Using tool: write]
   [Using tool: bash]
   The script ran successfully. Let me verify the output file.
   [Using tool: bash]
   fibonacci.txt contains the first 20 Fibonacci numbers (0 through 4181).

   Agent finished.
   ```

## What's happening

When you send a user event, Claude Managed Agents:

1. **Provisions a sandbox:** Your environment configuration determines how it's built.
2. **Runs the agent loop:** Claude determines which tools to use based on your message.
3. **Executes tools:** File writes, bash commands, and other tool calls run inside the sandbox.
4. **Streams events:** You receive real-time updates as the agent works.
5. **Goes idle:** The agent emits a `session.status_idle` event when it has nothing more to do.
